# Trader Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment
(Fear and Greed) and trader behavior on the Hyperliquid platform.

All analysis is performed using Google Colab notebooks.
# Data Files Note

The original Hyperliquid historical trading dataset is large (>25MB) and
cannot be uploaded directly to GitHub due to size limits.

The analysis uses the full dataset locally in Google Colab.
The processed and merged dataset (`merged_data.csv`) is included
for reproducibility and review.

The original raw dataset can be shared upon request.
